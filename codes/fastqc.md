# Introduction

In this tutorial, we will walk through the process of performing basic quality control (QC) on a sequencing file using FastQC. We will then assess the QC results to determine if trimming is needed.

## Step 1: Download and Install FastQC
Before running FastQC, you need to download and install it. You can find FastQC [here](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/)

## Step 2: Run FastQC
Now, let's run FastQC on your sequencing file.

  ```bash
# Find 'your_file.fastq' for your sample
fastqc "your_file.fastq"
```
This will generate a FastQC report for your sequencing file.

## Step 3: Assess FastQC Results
After running FastQC, open the generated report (your_file_fastqc.html). Look for sections that indicate potential issues such as:

Per base sequence quality
Per base sequence content
Sequence length distribution
Overrepresented sequences
If you observe any anomalies, it might be an indication that trimming is needed.

## Step 4: Determine if Trimming is Needed
Based on the FastQC results, decide whether trimming is necessary. If you see issues like low-quality bases at the beginning or end of sequences, adapter contamination, or overrepresented sequences, trimming might be beneficial.

Conclusion
Performing QC and assessing the need for trimming are crucial steps in preprocessing sequencing data. FastQC provides valuable insights into the quality of your data, helping you make informed decisions for downstream analysis.
