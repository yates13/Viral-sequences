## Installation

To run the code in this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- BWA (version 0.7.12 or higher)
- samtools (version 1.10 or higher)
- bcftools (version 1.10 or higher)

You can install these tools by following their respective installation instructions on their official websites.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd viral-sequencUpdate the paths and filenames in the provided scripts according to your dataset and reference genomes.

# Run the main script for read mapping and variant analysis:

bash
Copy code
./mapping.sh
Follow the on-screen prompts and provide the necessary inputs when prompted.

The output files, including alignment files, variant files, and consensus sequences, will be generated in the specified output directories.

## Results
The results of this project include:

- Aligned BAM files (sorted and indexed)
- Variant files (VCF format)
- Consensus sequences
- These outputs can be further analyzed and visualized using various tools such as IGV or custom scripts.
