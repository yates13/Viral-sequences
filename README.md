## Installation

Before running the viral sequence analysis, ensure that the following software and packages are installed:

- BWA (Burrows-Wheeler Aligner)
- Samtools
- BCFtools
- GATK (Genome Analysis Toolkit)
- FastQC

Make sure these tools are installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd viral-sequencUpdate the paths and filenames in the provided scripts according to your dataset and reference genomes.

# Run the main script for read mapping:

   ```bash
./mapping_k181.sh
```


The output files, including alignment files, and directories.

## Results
The results of this project include:

- Aligned BAM files (sorted and indexed)
- Variant files (VCF format)
- Consensus sequences
- These outputs can be further analyzed and visualized using various tools such as IGV or custom scripts.
